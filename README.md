# FEE-Project
This is the code of my FEE Project which is a Notes Pad or Note Log used for taking notes. It is made by just using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
In first Evaluation, just HTML, and CSS is used and it is made working in the second lab evaluation.
This Note Log is used to take all kind of notes and is also going to work as a To-Do List. You can also make changes in your notes and add them to the favorities and also save them.
